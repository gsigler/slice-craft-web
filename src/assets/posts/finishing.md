# Recommended Finishing for Slice Craft Models

You have bought a [Slice Craft model](https://www.etsy.com/shop/slicecraft) and now you are ready to add some pizzaz! Our models arrive at your door primed and ready to be finished using the following instructions. There are other ways to finish printed models but this technique is the one we use to finish our own pieces.

## Step 1 - Gather Your Supplies

Like any good craft project, the first step is getting the right supplies together. For finishing one of our models we recommend the following items:

- Several flat paint brushes in small to tiny sizes

- Clean water and a paper towel

- Paint palette, can be as simple as a paper plate

- 3 colors acrylic craft paint and white - I use one for the sides, one for the roof and one for the trim and door.

- Some kind of clear coating, I use a satin varnish but spray clear coats work too

- Model snow, I use DecoArt SnowTex with Glitter

## Step 2 - Begin Painting the House

When painting a house, I like to begin with the sides of the house. Add a little of your chosen paint color to the palette and add a tiny bit of water to it; the consistency will be slightly thicker than whole milk. Lay the paint down evenly, one side at a time, painting with the grain of the plastic. You will probably want to use several brushes as you go along to fit into all the spaces. Try to get the least amount of paint possible on the areas you don't want to be that color, it makes covering of them easier. Once you finish a single coat on all four sides move on to the next step.

## Step 3 - Paint the Roof & Trim

To give the side of the house time to dry before the next coat, I work in a rotation. I do a single coat on the side of the house, then the roof and then the trim. Then I start back over with the sides of the house. Each piece will need between 2-4 coats of paint before it is fully covered. The darker your paint color, the more coats it will need. The number of coats needed can also vary by acrylic paint brand. You want to make sure you wait until each layer is dry to add the next coat, otherwise you risk pulling back up the paint you already put down.

## Step 4 - Finishing Touches

Once all the coats of paint on your sides, roof and trim are done, you are ready for touch up work. For example, I leave the insides of my windows white when I paint my houses. After I am all done I will use a tiny bit of white paint and go through and cover any tiny spots of color that might have gotten where I didn't want them.

## Step 5 - Snow

Once everything looks the way you want, its time to add the snow! For me, this is the step that really makes the houses pop. Take one of your brushes to get a little bit of snow on the tip of your brush. Carefully apply the snow to the edges, ledges, lips, etc. of your building. I try to keep a consistent perspective on where I place the snow; if I do it on the left side of one window I do it on the left side of everything so it looks like the wind blew it that way. A little bit of snow goes a long way, so check yourself as you go.

## Step 6 - Sealing Your Masterpiece

After letting the snow and paint fully dry for several hours at least, you are ready to seal in all the cute details you added to your piece. For a paint on sealer, you will want to make sure to use a light pressure so you don't lift up the snow you placed on the building. If you use a spray this won't be a concern for you.
